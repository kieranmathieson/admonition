The admonition plugin lets authors add admonitions, like warnings,
notes, and hints.

Each admonition has two author-editable parts:

* Title
* Content

A typical output format will have a warning icon, and a color
background. 

Authors can change the admonition type with a GUI. The GUIs shows
a dialog where the author selects an admonition type using a radio
button, and sees a preview of the admonition.

Authors can also choose the alignment of the admonition: left, right, 
or centered. 

Authors can choose the width of the admonition: 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%,
or a custom value.

Admonition styles are defned by CSS files. The plugin reads
the names of the files, and turns the names
into style names, and labels.
